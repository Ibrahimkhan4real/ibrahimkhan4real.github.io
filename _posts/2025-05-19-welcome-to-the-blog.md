title: "Welcome to the new blog"
summary: "A short note about the new Markdown-powered journal."
---

This site now ships with a simple blog powered by GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

- Draft your post in Markdown
- Save it inside the `_posts` directory
- Use the `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md` filename format

Once you commit and push, GitHub Pages will rebuild automatically and the article will appear on the [blog listing](/blog/).
