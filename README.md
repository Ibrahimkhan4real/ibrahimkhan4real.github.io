## Experience

### Teaching Assistant and Lab Demonstrator  
**Coventry University, Coventry, UK**  
_Aug 2025 – Present_

- Conducted detailed labs for the “Deep Learning and Computer Vision” module, supporting MSc Data Science students.  
- Graded postgraduate coursework for MSc Data Science students, ensuring accurate and timely evaluation of assignments.  
- Collaborated with faculty to maintain smooth course delivery and provided feedback to improve teaching materials.

### Associate AI Engineer  
**CureMD, Lahore, Pakistan**  
_Jul 2023 – Sep 2024_

- Developed an in-house “LLM for Code”, an advanced tool similar to GitHub Copilot, leveraging RAG with Mixtral 8x7B for code explanation, generation, and translation to support software development.  
- Fine-tuned LLMs on a proprietary code base to develop a chatbot tailored for software specialists.  
- Utilised Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to develop a chatbot for the Customer Service Department.  
- Built an automated LLM-based “Code Grader” using Llama 3, which graded over 100 candidates in under a minute, evaluating code based on logic and black-box testing.  
- Applied machine learning and deep learning models to enhance internal productivity and create products for the US healthcare industry.

### Field Engineer – Intern  
**Engro Fertilizers, Daharki, Pakistan**  
_Jun 2022 – Aug 2022_

- Assisted with engine replacement of a 7700 HP aeroderivative engine (Taurus 60) during a 24-day forced outage.  
- Worked closely with the Field Service Representative from Egypt and produced a comprehensive report on the engine replacement.  
- Examined internal components and assemblies of centrifugal compressors and steam turbines and observed complete overhauls.
