# Welcome to the new blog

This site now ships with a simple Markdown-powered journal.

- Draft your post in Markdown.
- Drop it into `blog/posts/`.
- Add an entry to `blog/posts/posts.json` so the list knows about it.

Posts are rendered client-side using [Marked](https://marked.js.org/), so no build tools are required.
